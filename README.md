# Machine Learning

This repository contains all the coding assignments done in the COMP_570 (Machine Learning Course)

Python version used : 3.9.5
Packages used: Numpy, Matplotlib

Assignment 1 implementations:

1. Perceptron Model for Binary and Multi-class Classification
2. Averaged Perceptron Model for Binary and Multi-class Classification
3. Passive Aggressive Learning Model for Binary and Multi-class Classification

Data for the above implementation can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist

From the data above , seperate 60k as training examples and 10k as testing examples. The dataset files need to be in the same foleder as the python files with the name
fashion-mnist_train.csv and fashion-mnist_test.csv for training and testing data respectively.

Running the command : python3 <file_location/file_name.py>
